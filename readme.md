Manages and monitors artists, releases and downloads for a record label. Setup your own Creative Commons label in moments.

== Description ==

Every wanted to set up a Creative Commons record label with an incredibly swish site that works at least as well as the pros?
Ribcage does everything you need to setup a record label online in just a few clicks.

* Add artists, then add their releases with full colour artwork
* Artist details include biography, press images, integration with social media and their websites (including tight Twitter intergration)
* Artist RSS feeds for releases and any news you happen to tag correctly on the main blog
* Releases can be downloaded in a variety of formats, as individual files, or as .zip collections
* Releases can be downloaded through torrents, either by Clearbits or elsewhere
* Releases can be listened through on the site, either by using SoundCloud, or our own MP3 player included
* Those files you can listen to through SoundCloud are uploaded direct from Ribcage - yes, cool
* You can stream the release as a M3U or via XMPP on your favourite media player
* Got some good reviews? Add these to the release with ease and mess about with their order to put the best first
* Individually passworded press section for pre-releases
* Logging of release downloads (and in future many stats on this through Google Analytics!)
* Release RSS for your label as a whole
* Integrated comprehensive events plugin element associated with artists or the label as a whole
* Record label store - allow the purchase of physical versions associated with releases and artist merchandise
* Sell through PayPal or Google Checkout
* Everything is fully templatable - change everything to the way you like it
* Social Networking
** Use Twitter? Automatic tweeting on release, with a couple of reminders if you like, and a few before!
** Use Facebook? Automatic Facebook on release, before and reminders
** How about MySpace? Yes, its ugly, but yes, we update your status here as well
* Support for CDN (currently only Amazon Cloudfront)
* Support for other popular WordPress plugins, Yoast SEO and W3C Total Cache - yes, no more emptying the page cache!
* Little bits and pieces to make WordPress a little bit cooler - like re-writing of the image directory

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or - just install the plugin through the WordPress plugin interface.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Ribcage for providing paid for downloads? =

As it is released under the GPL, Ribcage could be easily adapted to provide this function. Yet we originally designed Ribcage for use for a Creative Commons record label and encourage you to consider this licensing for your own releases.
